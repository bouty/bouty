I've been using Git for a long time and I'm finally diving head first into GitHub. I have a long history primarily in .Net and Azure development and I'm looking to expand my horizons.

#### What tech I like to explore...
- Cloud solutions (Azure, AWS currently)
- Developer tools (I still like to code myself, empowering developers has been my main interest since stepping back from a dev manager position)

#### When away from code I...
- Cook for my family
- Run most days (ran a marathon, not sure if I'll do another)
- Mountain bike when I can get to trails (not as often as I'd like)
- Camp with my family and solo
- Care for plants/garden
- Volunteer to support families in my community
